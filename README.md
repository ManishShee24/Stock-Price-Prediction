# Stock-Price-Prediction
Stock price prediction is the process of forecasting future stock prices based on historical data and market indicators. 

It involves analyzing financial data using statistical models and machine learning algorithms to make predictions about a stock's future performance.

Stock market predictions can be for an individual stock, a particular sector, or the market as a whole. These forecasts generally use fundamental analysis of a company or economy, or technical analysis of charts, or a combination of the two. 

The goal of predicting stock prices is to gain significant profits. The price of a stock is largely determined by supply and demand. If demand is high, the price tends to go up, and if supply is high, the price tends to go down.
